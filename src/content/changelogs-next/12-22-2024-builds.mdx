We've added new features to [**Workers Builds**](/workers/ci-cd/builds/), the integrated CI/CD system for Workers (currently in beta), to improve build times and enhance monorepo support.

- **[Build Caching:](/workers/ci-cd/builds/build-caching/)** Cache dependencies and build outputs between builds with a shared project-wide cache, ensuring faster builds for the entire team.

- **[Build Watch Paths:](/workers/ci-cd/builds/build-watch-paths/)** Define paths to include or exclude from the build process, ideal for monorepos to target only the files that need to be rebuilt per Workers project.

Both features are now available for Workers projects with Builds enabled. To get started, select your [Worker on the Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com) then go to **Settings > Builds**, and connect a GitHub or GitLab repository. Once connected, you'll see options to configure Build Cache and Build Watch Paths settings.
